  <h1>Sentiment Analysis of Medications</h1>
  <p><strong>University:</strong> University of Huddersfield</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Tweepy, TextBlob, Matplotlib, WordCloud</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>My research explored public sentiment toward prescription medications by analyzing unstructured Twitter data. The aim was to understand how patient opinions, experiences, and concerns varied across drug categories.</p>

  <h3>What I Did</h3>
  <p>Using the Tweepy API, I collected thousands of tweets related to selected medications. I cleaned and preprocessed the data, then performed sentiment classification using TextBlob. I also created frequency plots, word clouds, and polarity histograms to visualize public opinion trends.</p>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>The analysis revealed sentiment shifts tied to product recalls, news cycles, and public awareness campaigns. The project demonstrated my ability to work with real-world text data, apply sentiment models, and derive insights from social media signals — skills directly transferable to digital analytics and consumer research.</p>
