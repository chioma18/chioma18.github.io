  <h1>E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard</h1>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> Hankali Intel</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Excel, Power BI</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>I developed an end-to-end data pipeline to support competitive analysis for e-commerce strategy. The goal was to help the company gain insight into pricing trends and product availability across multiple competitors.</p>

  <h3>What I Did</h3>
  <p>I built a Python script using BeautifulSoup to scrape product data (name, price, ratings, and stock status) from a leading e-commerce platform. The data was cleaned and structured in Pandas, exported to Excel, and visualized using Power BI. The dashboard allowed stakeholders to track price fluctuations and identify seasonal patterns in competitor inventory.</p>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>The dashboard became a weekly reference for the business team and contributed to more informed pricing decisions. It also reduced the time spent on manual competitor tracking by over 50 percent.</p>
