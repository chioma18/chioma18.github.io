  <h1>Customer Churn Prediction Model</h1>
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Supervised Machine Learning</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>This project involved building a predictive model to classify customers at risk of churning from a subscription-based service. It focused on identifying key indicators of churn to support business retention strategies.</p>

  <h3>What I Did</h3>
  <p>I cleaned and prepared the dataset, explored features, and built a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn. I also evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score. Visuals were created to show the distribution of churned customers across key variables.</p>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>The project demonstrated my ability to apply predictive analytics to a real-world business scenario. It also helped me understand how data science can guide retention efforts and customer experience strategies.</p>
