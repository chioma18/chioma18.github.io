  <h1>Business Valuation Regression Model</h1>
  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Business Analytics | Regression</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>This project applied regression analysis to predict company valuations based on operational and market features such as revenue, employee count, and industry sector. The goal was to simulate how data-driven models can support financial decision making and startup assessments.</p>

  <h3>What I Did</h3>
  <p>I built and compared multiple regression models using Scikit-learn. I performed feature engineering, explored correlations, and visualized key relationships using Seaborn. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and RMSE metrics.</p>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>This project helped me understand how data science techniques can be applied to valuation models and financial analysis. It showcased my ability to translate raw business data into insights that inform strategy, investment, or growth planning.</p>
